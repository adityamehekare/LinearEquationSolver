# LinearEquationSolver

## Overview :
>1. It helps to solve **linear equation of two variables**. 
>2. It plots the representating graph for the equations ***(not to scale)*** without using available plotting libraries.


## The Input Details :

- Enter the values of coefficients in equation 1 ie. a, b, and c which is in the form ax + by = c .
- Enter the values of coefficients in equation 2 ie. p, q, and r which is in the form px + qy = r .

## The Output :
1. It solves the equations using **Cramer's Rule**.
2. It also solves the quation using **Substitution Method**.
3. It plots the **Graph** representing those two equations.
